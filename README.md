# Campus Cruise - Smart Indoor Navigation System

Campus Cruise is a web-based indoor navigation system designed to guide users within multi-floor buildings such as college campuses. It displays the shortest path from source to destination using coordinate-based logic, and includes staircase routing when moving between floors. Built using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas, it provides a simple and effective way to solve indoor navigation problems.

## Features

- Interactive floor maps with custom path rendering
- Multi-floor navigation using staircase connections
- Coordinate-based routing logic for accurate pathfinding
- Responsive and user-friendly interface

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Canvas API)
- Optional backend support (MongoDB, Firebase for future updates)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the index.html file in your browser
3. 
## How It Works

- Each floor layout is drawn using the HTML5 Canvas
- Important points like rooms and stairs are mapped using coordinates
- When the start and end points are on different floors, the path includes the staircase and continues on the next floor

## Use Cases

- College and university campuses
- Hospitals and medical facilities
- Malls and shopping centers
- Corporate or government buildings

## Future Enhancements

- Room name search and auto-suggestions
- Backend integration for real-time map updates
- User location detection through QR codes or GPS beacons
